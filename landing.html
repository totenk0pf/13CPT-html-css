                        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
                            The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:</p><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
                                <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
                                <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
                                <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
                                <li>Readability counts.</li>
                            </ul><br>
                        <p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.</p><br>

                        <p>	Python was developed in the late 1980s as a language that would be more intuitive and human-readable than languages like C++. Generally speaking, C++ is considered more complicated, error-prone, and closer to being a low-level language. On the totem pole of user-friendliness, this puts C++ near the bottom where actual CPU machine code lives.
                            Python was created to be elegant, and even pleasant to work in. Much less emphasis is placed on conventional syntax, making learning and debugging code less rage-inducing. Factors like readability, use of white space, and a wealth of excellent documentation and communities make Python easier for beginners to learn.<br><br>
                            Even if you are not a programmer, learning Python can help you in specific fields. Python is already king in hot tech fields like data science, machine learning, and information security. Universities and colleges also use Python. All these fields use Python — extensively. They even have their own sets of libraries, which are like code add-ons that provide functionality without having to code from scratch.
                            Whether focusing on Python or using it as the first step toward broader coding career, it’s the best language for beginners. </p>

                <h3>Why you should choose Python</h3><br>
                <div class="landing-text">
                    <p>	As an open source programming language, Python helps you to curtail software development cost significantly. You can even use several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools to curtail development time without increasing development cost. You even have option to choose from a wide range of open source Python frameworks and development tools according to your precise needs. For instance, you can simplify and speedup web application development by using robust Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid, Bottle and Cherrypy. Likewise, you can accelerate desktop GUI application development using Python GUI frameworks and toolkits like PyQT, PyJs, PyGUI, Kivy, PyGTK and WxPython.<br><br>
                    You can use Python to create prototype of the software application rapidly. Also, you can build the software application directly from the prototype simply by refactoring the Python code. Python even makes it easier for you to perform coding and testing simultaneously by adopting test driven development (TDD) approach. You can easily write the required tests before writing code and use the tests to assess the application code continuously. The tests can also be used for checking if the application meets predefined requirements based on its source code.</p><br>
